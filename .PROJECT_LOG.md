## Event Log

### 2026-02-14

- **Image System Overhaul**: Pollinations.ai service became unreliable (HTTP 530). Replaced ALL 24 post images with local SVG files featuring:
  - Unique keywords per post (e.g., CLAUDE, GEMINI, XAI, SPACE)
  - Category-based colors
  - Simple circle design with bold title
- **Klaro Fix**: Replaced broken Klaro config with working version from DomenaRynku (EN translations, mustConsent: true)
- **Google Tag Manager**: Added GTM-WR6KBLTV with Consent Mode v2 (following DomenaRynku pattern)
- **SVG Design Iterations**: Multiple iterations to improve readability - simplified from multi-keyword to single unique keyword per post
- **New Publications**:
  - Gemini 3 Deep Think (subagent published)
  - xAI Interplanetary Ambitions
  - Transformers.js v5 (recreated - file was empty)
- **Image Fixes**:
  - Fixed broken images (local .jpg/.png) - changed to Pollinations.ai URLs
  - Fixed nofollow links (spacing issue: `{rel="nofollow"}` → `{rel="nofollow"}`)
  - Fixed published_topics.json (missing comma)
  - Fixed image URLs: `image.pollinations.ai/prompt/` → `pollinations.ai/p/`
- **Issue**: Pollinations.ai currently returns HTTP 530 - service down
- **Cookie Consent**: Added Klaro (klaro-config.js + klaro-head.html)
