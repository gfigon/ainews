As AI agents tackle increasingly complex tasks that span thousands of turns and millions of tokens, they face a silent performance killer: **context rot**. This occurs when relevant information is buried or lost as the model's memory fills up. LangChain has recently shared insights into how their **Deep Agents SDK** manages this challenge.

### Advanced Compression Strategies

The Deep Agents harness uses three primary techniques to maintain "agentic" focus without breaking context limits:

1.  **Tool Result Offloading:** Large responses (over 20,000 tokens) are automatically saved to a filesystem. The agent receives a file path and a 10-line preview, allowing it to "search" or "re-read" the data only when needed.
2.  **Input Truncation:** Redundant information, such as full file contents from previous write operations, is evicted from active memory once the context crosses 85% capacity.
3.  **Intelligent Summarization:** When offloading isn't enough, an LLM generates a structured summary of session intent, artifacts created, and next steps. This summary replaces the full history, while the original messages are archived on disk.

### Testing Recoverability

A key takeaway for developers is that compression is only as good as its **recoverability**. LangChain emphasizes "targeted evals"—deliberately small tests like "needle-in-a-haystack" scenarios—to ensure that even after a history is summarized, the agent can still retrieve specific, archived details to finish the task.

By combining filesystem-backed memory with strategic summarization, the next generation of agents can stay on track for tasks that take hours or even days to complete.
