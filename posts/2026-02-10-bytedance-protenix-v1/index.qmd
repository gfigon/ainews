## The Big Picture

Can an open-source model truly match AlphaFold3's performance? **ByteDance says yes.** Their new Protenix-v1 model, released under Apache 2.0, achieves AF3-level accuracy across proteins, DNA, RNA, and ligands — while keeping everything open for research and production use.

This isn't just another AlphaFold clone. Protenix-v1 includes a complete training pipeline, pre-trained weights, and a browser-based server for interactive predictions. The real differentiator? A rigorous evaluation toolkit called PXMeter that benchmarks over 6,000 complexes with transparent metrics.

## Why It Matters

AlphaFold3 revolutionized biomolecular structure prediction but remained largely closed. Protenix-v1 democratizes this capability:

- **Full open stack**: Code, weights, training pipelines — all available on [GitHub](https://github.com/bytedance/Protenix){rel="nofollow"}
- **Fair comparisons**: Model matches AF3's training data cutoff (2021-09-30) and inference budget
- **Extensible**: Designed for customization, not just inference

The research team claims Protenix-v1 is the first open-source model to **outperform AlphaFold3** on diverse benchmark sets under matched constraints.

## The Technical Core

Protenix-v1 implements an AF3-style diffusion architecture for all-atom complexes:

- **Parameters**: 368M (matching AF3's undisclosed scale class)
- **Coverage**: Proteins, nucleic acids, ligands
- **Inference scaling**: Log-linear accuracy gains with more sampled candidates

The included PXMeter v1.0.0 toolkit provides:
- Curated benchmark dataset (6,000+ complexes)
- Time-split and domain-specific subsets
- Unified metrics: complex LDDT, DockQ

## Beyond Structure Prediction

The Protenix ecosystem extends beyond prediction:

- **PXDesign**: Binder design suite with 20–73% experimental hit rates
- **Protenix-Dock**: Classical docking framework
- **Protenix-Mini**: Lightweight variants for cost-effective inference

## Key Takeaways

1. **AF3-class, fully open**: First open-source model matching AlphaFold3 performance
2. **Fair benchmarking**: PXMeter enables transparent, reproducible evaluations
3. **Production-ready**: Includes training code, weights, and a web server
4. **Extensible ecosystem**: Covers prediction, docking, and design
