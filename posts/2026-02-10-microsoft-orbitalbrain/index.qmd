## The Problem: Satellite Data Never Reaches Earth

Earth observation constellations capture **363,563 images per day** at maximum rate. But due to downlink constraints, only **11.7%** of that data ever reaches ground stations within 24 hours.

Microsoft researchers asked: What if we trained models **in space** instead?

## Enter OrbitalBrain

Instead of satellites as passive data collectors, OrbitalBrain turns nanosatellite constellations into distributed training systems. Models train, aggregate, and update directly on orbit — using onboard compute, inter-satellite links, and predictive scheduling.

### Core Philosophy

The framework recognizes three key satellite characteristics:
- Constellations are typically single-operator, enabling raw data sharing
- Orbits, power, and ground visibility are **predictable**
- Inter-satellite links (ISLs) and onboard accelerators are now practical

### How It Works

Each satellite performs three actions under a cloud-computed schedule:
- **Local Compute**: Train on stored imagery
- **Model Aggregation**: Exchange parameters over ISLs
- **Data Transfer**: Rebalance data distribution between satellites

A cloud controller predicts orbital dynamics, power budgets, and link opportunities to optimize the schedule.

## Why Federated Learning Fails in Space

Standard FL approaches (AsyncFL, SyncFL, FedBuff, FedSpace) break down under real satellite constraints:

- **Intermittent connectivity**: Updates become stale before aggregation
- **Power limits**: Computing competes with essential operations
- **Non-i.i.d. data**: Each satellite sees different scenes

Result: **10–40% accuracy degradation** compared to idealized conditions.

## OrbitalBrain Results

Simulated on real constellations (Planet: 207 sats, 12 ground stations; Spire: 117 sats):

| Task | Baseline Best | OrbitalBrain | Improvement |
|------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| fMoW (Planet) | 47.3% | 52.8% | +5.5% |
| fMoW (Spire) | 40.1% | 59.2% | +19.1% |
| So2Sat (Planet) | 42.4% | 47.9% | +5.5% |
| So2Sat (Spire) | 42.2% | 47.1% | +4.9% |

**Time-to-accuracy**: 1.52×–12.4× faster than ground-based approaches.

## The Bottom Line

OrbitalBrain proves that satellite constellations can act as **distributed ML systems**, not just data sources. This enables:
- Real-time models for forest fire detection
- Fresh flood monitoring data
- Climate analytics without multi-day delays

The future of Earth observation isn't just better sensors — it's **better coordination**.
