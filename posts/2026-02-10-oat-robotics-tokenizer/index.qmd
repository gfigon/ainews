## The Tokenization Wall

Large language models predict the next word. Shouldn't they predict the next robot move? The challenge: **continuous robot movements don't tokenize easily**.

Previous approaches failed:
- **Binning**: Creates massive, slow sequences
- **FAST**: Fast but unreliable — small errors halt robots
- **Learned Latent Tokenizers**: Safe but unordered, losing temporal structure

Researchers from **Harvard and Stanford** identified three non-negotiables for robot tokenization:

1. **High Compression** — Short token sequences
2. **Total Decodability** — Every sequence maps to a valid move
3. **Causal Ordering** — Left-to-right structure, global first, details later

## Enter Ordered Action Tokenization (OAT)

OAT uses a transformer encoder with **register tokens** to summarize action chunks. The key innovation: **Nested Dropout** forces the model to learn important patterns first.

### How It Works

- Actions are chunked into discrete tokens
- Registers summarize each chunk
- Nested Dropout prioritizes coarse → fine information
- Tokens are left-to-right causally ordered

The result: A tokenizer that plays nicely with autoregressive next-token prediction.

## Benchmark Results

Across 20+ tasks in 4 simulation benchmarks:

| Benchmark | OAT Success | Diffusion Policy | Token Reduction |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| LIBERO | 56.3% | 36.6% | 224 → 8 |
| RoboMimic | 73.1% | 67.1% | 224 → 8 |
| MetaWorld | 24.4% | 19.3% | 128 → 8 |
| RoboCasa | 54.6% | 54.0% | 384 → 8 |

**Aggregate improvement: 52.3% success rate vs. baseline**

## The "Anytime" Revolution

Most practical benefit: **prefix-based detokenization**.

Since tokens are ordered by importance:
- 1–2 tokens → coarse direction (low latency)
- 8 tokens → full precision (complex insertions)

This flexible trade-off between computation cost and action fidelity was impossible with fixed-length tokenizers.

## Why This Matters

Robotics is entering its "GPT-3 era" — but only if we solve the tokenization gap. OAT provides:

- **Reliability**: Total decodability prevents execution failures
- **Scalability**: Short sequences enable efficient autoregressive training
- **Flexibility**: Anytime inference adapts to real-world constraints
