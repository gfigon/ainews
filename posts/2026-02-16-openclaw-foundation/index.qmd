**Peter Steinberger**, the creator of OpenClaw (formerly known as Clawdbot and Moltbot), is joining OpenAI to lead the development of the next generation of personal AI agents.

## What Happened

Sam Altman announced on X that Steinberger will "drive the next generation of personal agents" at OpenAI. In a blog post, Steinberger explained his decision: "What I want is to change the world, not build a large company, and teaming up with OpenAI is the fastest way to bring this to everyone."

## OpenClaw's Journey

OpenClaw achieved viral popularity over the past few weeks with its promise to be the "AI that actually does things" — managing calendars, booking flights, and even joining a social network of AI assistants.

The project went through several name changes:
- Originally **Clawdbot** (named after Claude)
- Changed to **Moltbot** after Anthropic threatened legal action
- Finally renamed to **OpenClaw**

## What's Next for OpenClaw

Altman confirmed that OpenClaw will "live in a foundation as an open source project that OpenAI will continue to support." This marks a significant shift for the project — from a potential startup to an open-source initiative backed by OpenAI.

The move reflects OpenAI's belief in an "extremely multi-agent" AI future, where multiple AI assistants collaborate to help users accomplish complex tasks.

## Industry Impact

This hiring represents OpenAI's strategic push into personal AI agents — a space where startups like OpenClaw have been gaining traction. By bringing in experienced developers from the open-source community, Big AI companies are racing to dominate the personal assistant market.
