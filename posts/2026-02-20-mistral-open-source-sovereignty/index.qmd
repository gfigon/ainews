The AI world is grappling with a fundamental tension that played out in full view at the India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi this week: on one side, a handful of tech giants consolidating unprecedented control over artificial intelligence; on the other, a growing movement toward open-source alternatives and national AI sovereignty.

## Mistral's Warning: Three Companies Owning AI

Arthur Mensch, co-founder and CEO of France's Mistral AI, delivered a stark warning at the summit on Thursday. "We're facing too much concentration of power in artificial intelligence," Mensch said. "We don't want to be in a world where three or four enormous companies actually own the deployment and the making of AI."

The comment, reported by Bloomberg, reflects growing concerns among open-source advocates and smaller AI players about the increasing dominance of Microsoft, Google, and NVIDIA in the AI ecosystem. Mensch has been vocal about the need for open-source AI as a counterweight to corporate control, positioning Mistral as a European champion of accessible, customizable AI models.

## India's Sovereign AI Response

Just hours after Mensch's comments, India announced its own response to these concerns: three sovereign AI models designed to reduce reliance on big tech systems. The models—developed by Sarvam AI, Gnani.ai, and BharatGen—were unveiled at the same summit, signaling India's ambition to establish independent AI capabilities.

The IndiaAI Mission, launched in 2024 with ₹10,371.92 crore in funding, aims to add 20,000 GPUs to India's compute infrastructure. Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the summit, emphasizing that inclusive technology for everyone should be the goal.

## The Bigger Picture

These two developments illustrate the emerging fault lines in the global AI landscape:

- **Market concentration concerns**: A small number of companies control the compute infrastructure, foundation models, and deployment platforms that define the AI industry
- **Open-source pushback**: Companies like Mistral argue that open-weight models offer a path to democratize AI and prevent vendor lock-in
- **National AI sovereignty**: Countries like India are investing in domestic AI capabilities to reduce dependence on foreign technology

The tension between these perspectives is likely to define AI policy discussions throughout 2026 and beyond.
