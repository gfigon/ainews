Google has just released **Gemini 3.1 Pro**, marking a significant leap forward in AI reasoning capabilities. The model scored an impressive **77.1% on the ARC-AGI-2 reasoning benchmark**—a massive jump from the 31.1% achieved by its predecessor, Gemini 3 Pro.

## Key Highlights

### Benchmark Performance

Gemini 3.1 Pro not only dominates the ARC-AGI-2 reasoning benchmark but also takes the top spot across multiple other benchmarks:

- **Science** 
- **Competitive coding**
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) use**
- **Agentic search**

This positions 3.1 Pro as a serious contender against Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.6 (68.8%) and OpenAI's GPT-5.2 (52.9%).

### Pricing and Accessibility

Despite the substantial performance improvements, Google has kept the API pricing identical to Gemini 3 Pro. The model maintains a **1M token context window** while offering more competitive pricing compared to frontier models from Anthropic and OpenAI.

### Integration with Deep Think

The 3.1 Pro model serves as the core intelligence behind Google's recent **Deep Think** update, now available across:

- Gemini app
- NotebookLM  
- Developer tools

## Why It Matters

After letting Anthropic and OpenAI dominate AI headlines in early 2026, Google has made a commanding comeback. The combination of Deep Think and Gemini 3.1 Pro signals Google's return to the "world's top model" conversation.

Industry analysts expect OpenAI to respond with a counter-announcement sooner rather than later—potentially with GPT-5.3 or a major reasoning-focused update.
